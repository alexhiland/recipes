Ingredients:
 - 2 tbsp olive oil
 - 1 large onion, diced
 - 3 cloves garlic, minced
 - 3 medium carrots, diced
 - 3 stalks celery, diced
 - 2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced
 - 2 tsp Italian seasoning
 - 4 cups vegetable broth + 1 cup water
 - 2-15oz can diced tomatoes
 - 1 cup corn (I used thawed from frozen)
 - 1-15oz can kidney beans, drained and rinsed (optional)
 - 1 bay leaf
 - 1/4 cup parsley, chopped
 - 1 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice, more to taste
 - 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt, more to taste
 - Freshly ground black pepper


Directions:
 1. Heat oil in a large stockpot or dutch oven over medium-low heat. 
    Once hot, add onion, garlic and a teaspoon of kosher salt and cook about 8 minutes. 
    Add carrots, celery, potatoes and cook for 5 more minutes, stirring often. 
    Add Italian seasoning and cook for one more minute.

 2. Add broth, water, tomatoes, corn, beans, bay leaf, and several grinds of pepper. 
    Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered until the vegetables are tender, about 35 minutes.

 3. Remove from heat and stir in parsley and lemon juice. 
    Remove bay leaf and season to taste with salt (don’t be shy, I added lots of salt!) and pepper. 
    Serve hot with crusty bread.
